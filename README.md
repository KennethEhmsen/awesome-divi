## Layout

* [Footer Layout Pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-footer-layout-pack-10-unique-footer-designs-to-give-your-site-a-leg-up) - Designing a great footer is more challenging than it may seem. That’s why having an attractive starting point is such a valuable resource. The footer designs in this layout pack are highly versatile and can be used as they are or with minor design tweaks for many, if not most, websites.
* [Header Layout Pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-download-the-divi-header-ui-kit) - We’ve created a kit that includes ten different headers made from Divi Builder sections.
* [Profile pages Layout Pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-download-the-profile-pages-layout-pack) - The Profile Page Layout Pack is perfect for personal landing pages within a larger site or even for micro “about me” websites. Just install the layout pack, take your pick from the styles below, or mix and match to come up with something all your own.

## Resource

* [Mega Menu](https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/divi/mega-menus/) - Mega menus allow users to see more links all at once without the hassle of scrolling, hovering, and remembering the contents of your menu. A good way to think about Mega Menus is that they are drop down menus within drop down menus. So instead of your normal dropdown menu which shows a submenu when hovering over your main parent links in your navigation bar, a megamenu allows you to have additional parent links and submenus within the dropdown menu.
